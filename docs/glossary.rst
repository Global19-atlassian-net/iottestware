   MQTT
      The MQ Telemetry Transport is a machine-to-machine (M2M) / :term:`Internet of Things` connectivity protocol.
      It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.
      It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
